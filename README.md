# Exploration of the Python API RLGym


## What technology you wanted to explore

I wanted to explore the python API RLGym which is an api that makes it easier to interact with the Rocket League game environment and code an ai using reinforcement learning. It is an api that connects with the game and attempts to control the speed of the physics engine in-game to make reinforcement learning faster and creating an ai a bit more of a phesible task. 

## What you thought you might need the technology for

The solution I wanted to go forward with was a combination of the solutions I discussed with the person I interviewed. Essentially I wanted to create a better Rocket League AI then what is availible in-game and ones that you can download externally. Then I wanted to try to figure out a way to insert these AI into Rocket League's Training Mode and/or Free Mode to add the player experience within these game modes. To accomplish this, I needed to find a way to make a better AI and the idea was to attempt an AI that uses a combination of Machine Learning and expert systems depending on the actions being performed. 

## Whether you think the technology would be a good fit for that based on the thing you hacked

* If it works:
  - tell me how to test it
  - hand in multiple attempts if you have them (clarify which is which)
  - My only concern would be the speed of the games. Currently, 


## What the thing you hacked is supposed to do
