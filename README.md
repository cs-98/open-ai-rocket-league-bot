# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What technology you wanted to explore

I wanted to explore the python API RLGym which tries to make it easier to treat the Rocket League environment as a Machine Learning . It is an api that connects with the game and attempts to control the speed of the physics engine in-game as well as 

## What you thought you might need the technology for

The solution I wanted to go forward with was a combination of the solutions I discussed with the person I interviewed. Essentially I wanted to create a better Rocket League AI then what is availible in-game and ones that you can download externally. Then I wanted to try to figure out a way to insert these AI into Rocket League's Training Mode and/or Free Mode to add the player experience within these game modes. To accomplish this, I needed to find a way to make a better AI and the idea was to attempt an AI that uses a combination of Machine Learning and expert systems depending on the actions being performed. 

## Whether you think the technology would be a good fit for that based on the thing you hacked

* If it works:
  - tell me how to test it
  - hand in multiple attempts if you have them (clarify which is which)


## What the thing you hacked is supposed to do
TODO: short description 

Include some screenshots.
